## Short Story
- I changed my system from Manjaro to Endeavour last month. My DE is KDE. But I found vim installed by using `pacman -S vim` can't copy to system's clipboard. After typing `vim --version|grep clipboard`, I saw -clipboard. I read a lot posts. Finally, I installed NeoVim. It's just awesome as vim.
